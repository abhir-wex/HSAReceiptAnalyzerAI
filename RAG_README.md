# HSA Receipt Analyzer with RAG Implementation

## Overview

This enhanced HSA Receipt Analyzer now includes a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system that provides contextual fraud analysis by leveraging historical fraud patterns and knowledge.

## ?? Real-World RAG Use Cases in HSA Fraud Detection

### 1. **Contextual Fraud Analysis**
- **What it does**: When analyzing a new claim, RAG searches through historical fraud cases to find similar patterns
- **Real example**: New claim for $250 at "HealthMart Pharmacy" ? RAG finds 3 similar fraud cases at same merchant with round amounts
- **Business value**: Provides investigators with specific historical context instead of generic ML scores

### 2. **Expert Knowledge Retention**
- **What it does**: Captures and retains fraud investigation expertise in a searchable knowledge base
- **Real example**: Experienced fraud analyst retires ? Their knowledge of specific fraud schemes remains accessible through RAG
- **Business value**: Institutional knowledge preservation and consistent fraud detection quality

### 3. **Pattern Evolution Detection**
- **What it does**: Identifies how fraud patterns evolve over time by comparing new cases to historical trends
- **Real example**: "SharedReceiptAcrossUsers" pattern evolving to include IP address manipulation
- **Business value**: Proactive fraud prevention and early detection of emerging schemes

## ?? Sample RAG Analysis Output

### Traditional Response (Before RAG):
```json
{
  "IsFraudulent": true,
  "FraudScore": 85,
  "Message": "? High risk claim detected"
}
```

### Enhanced RAG Response (After RAG):
```json
{
  "IsFraudulent": true,
  "FraudScore": 87.5,
  "RiskLevel": "High",
  "MLScore": 82.0,
  "RAGConfidence": 0.89,
  "Message": "? FRAUD DETECTED (87.5%, High risk). This pattern matches 3 historical fraud case(s). Key factors: Round amount pattern, Same-day submission.",
  "RAGAnalysis": "Based on historical fraud patterns, this claim shows HIGH similarity to confirmed fraud cases. The $250.00 amount at HealthMart Pharmacy matches the 'RoundAmountPattern' template seen in 3 previous cases. The same-day submission pattern is consistent with urgent fraud attempts.",
  "SimilarHistoricalCases": [
    {
      "Relevance": 0.92,
      "Summary": "FRAUD CASE: $250 at HealthMart Pharmacy, SharedReceiptAcrossUsers pattern...",
      "Source": "FraudKnowledgeBase"
    }
  ],
  "RiskFactors": ["Round amount pattern", "Same-day submission", "High similarity to known fraud cases"],
  "RecommendedAction": "Verify receipt authenticity and item details; Cross-reference receipt hash across all users"
}
```

```

### Key Components

1. **RAGService** (`Services/RAGService.cs`)
   - Manages fraud knowledge base indexing and searching
   - Provides contextual analysis using historical patterns
   - Implements fallback local storage for reliability

2. **FraudKnowledgeEntry** (`Models/FraudKnowledgeEntry.cs`)
   - Structured representation of fraud cases in knowledge base
   - Includes contextual metadata and risk factors

3. **RAGAnalyzeController** (`Controllers/RAGAnalyzeController.cs`)
   - Enhanced fraud analysis endpoints
   - Combines ML predictions with RAG insights

### Configuration

The RAG system automatically initializes on application startup:

```csharp
// In Program.cs
using (var scope = app.Services.CreateScope())
{
    var ragService = scope.ServiceProvider.GetRequiredService<IRAGService>();
    await ragService.InitializeKnowledgeBaseAsync(); // Indexes existing fraud cases
}
```

## ?? Business Impact

### Before RAG:
- **Generic Analysis**: "85% fraud likelihood based on ML model"
- **No Context**: Investigators start from scratch with each case
- **Limited Insights**: Basic pattern detection without historical context

### After RAG:
- **Contextual Analysis**: "87.5% fraud likelihood - matches 3 similar cases at HealthMart with SharedReceiptAcrossUsers pattern"
- **Historical Context**: "This merchant has appeared in 5 previous fraud cases with similar amounts"
- **Actionable Insights**: "Cross-reference receipt hash AD3FBA2FA73E7095 - used by USR0009 and USR0014"

## ?? Real Use Case Example

### Scenario: Investigating Suspicious $250 Claim

1. **New Claim Submitted**: 
   - Amount: $250.00
   - Merchant: HealthMart Pharmacy
   - User: USR0501

2. **RAG Analysis Process**:
   ```
   Search Query: "HealthMart Pharmacy $250 Medical Equipment"
   ?
   Knowledge Base Search Results:
   - 92% relevance: Previous fraud at HealthMart for $250 (SharedReceiptAcrossUsers)
   - 88% relevance: Round amount fraud pattern at HealthMart
   - 85% relevance: Same merchant, different user, similar timeframe
   ```

3. **Enhanced Investigation Result**:
   ```
   FRAUD ALERT: This claim matches known fraud pattern "SharedReceiptAcrossUsers"
   Historical Evidence: Receipt hash found in 2 previous fraud cases
   Investigation Priority: HIGH - Cross-reference immediately
   Recommended Action: Contact HealthMart to verify transaction authenticity
   ```

## ?? Future Enhancements

1. **Vector Embeddings**: Enhanced semantic similarity search
2. **Real-time Learning**: Continuous knowledge base updates
3. **Advanced Analytics**: Fraud network analysis and relationship mapping
4. **Integration**: Connect with external fraud databases and industry knowledge

## ?? Usage Instructions
